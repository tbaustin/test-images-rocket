# Warning

To avoid extreme bodily injury when shooting an overdraw, or any other arrow support - shoot only with the blades in the closed position (where applicable) and make sure the O-rings fit in the angular groove and around the blade notch before each shot. As O-ring thickness may vary, manually inspect each O-ring before each shot, and after the broadheads have been exposed to any weather condition for any length of time. Prolonged exposure to sun may damage or weaken O-rings and may need to be replaced regularly. To prevent damage to you or your equipment from misuse, misapplication, or abuse of any Rocket Broadhead, have a competent pro shop install and inspect your archery equipment frequently.
