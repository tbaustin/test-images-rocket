I use this in a half court slab in the back yard and I couldn't ask for more. The mechanism that raises and lowers the hoop failed after like 15 years on my first hoop and Goalrilla replaced my entire set up with the GSIII under warranty. No charge for shipping or anything. I've a very happy camper!",
