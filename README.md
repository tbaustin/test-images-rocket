## Build Webhooks

[Documentation on Netlify webhoooks can be found here](https://www.netlify.com/docs/webhooks/)

Make sure to setup webhooks that might affect the build process, like product changes and review approval. If you are setting up a webhook to trigger a build on a Google Sheets change, you can use the [Trigger & Send](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trigger-send/lmpdaoninbfpblmajgcodhookngnekek?hl=en-US) add-on.
